## Denoising

**Files:** `stats.qzv`  

**Purpose:** Filter and denoise the raw reads, removing low-quality or chimeric sequences.

**Interpretation:**  
- **Filter summary:** Shows how many reads passed each filtering step.  
- **Sorting:** The interactive table allows sorting based on different columns. For example, sorting based on **percentage of input passed filter** gives insights about the sequencing quality.  
- This step shows how your data was “cleaned up” before downstream analysis.
