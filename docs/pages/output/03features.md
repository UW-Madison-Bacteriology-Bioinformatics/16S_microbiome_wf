## Feature Table and Representative Sequences

**Files:**  
- `table.qzv`  
- `rep-seqs.qzv`  

**Purpose:** Summarizes the abundance and identity of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in your dataset.

**Interpretation:**  
- `rep-seqs.qzv`: Shows representative sequences for each feature (ASV).  
  - Use this file if you want to inspect the actual **FASTA sequences**.  
- `table.qzv`: Displays the **abundance** of each feature across samples.  
  - Overview: High-level statistics of frequency.  
  - Interactive Sample Detail: Tells you how many times a feature appears in each sample. It's useful for visualizing community composition and richness.  
  - Feature Detail: Frequency table of each feature.
