## Alpha & Beta Diversity

**Files:**
- `evenness.qzv`
- `faith-pd.qzv`
- `unweighted_unifrac.qzv`  

**Purpose:** Quantifies and compares microbial diversity within and between samples.

**Interpretation:**  
- These three files have the same function but use different statistic methods.  
- `evenness.qzv`: Compares how evenly species are distributed across samples.  
  - Look for **p-values** comparing different groups.
- `faith-pd.qzv`: Similar to evenness but uses **phylogenetic diversity** instead of counts.
- `unweighted_unifrac.qzv`: Tests **beta diversity** differences between groups.
