# Output Interpretation Guide

For the outputs of this pipeline (`.qza` and `.qzv` files), you should be able to open them with [QIIME2 View](https://view.qiime2.org/). This page explains the purpose and interpretation of major output file generated by the 16S microbiome workflow. Most of files that are explained here are `.qzv` files, since they are visualizations of data.  

{: .note }
For more details, refer to QIIME2’s official [tutorial](https://amplicon-docs.qiime2.org/en/latest/). 

## Demultiplexing

**File:** `demux.qzv`  
**Purpose:** Provides basic statistics and quality information about your raw input reads.  

**Interpretation:**
-  **Sequence count summary:** Check the number of forward and reverse reads for each sample. The counts should roughly match: large mismatches may indicate pairing or sequencing issues.  
-  **Interactive quality plot:** Displays the average quality score per base position.  
        - Look for the position where the quality drops sharply.  
        - This helps you decide your **trimming lengths** for DADA2.  

## Denoising

**Files:** `stats.qzv`  
**Purpose:** Filter and denoise the raw reads, removing low-quality or chimeric sequences.

**Interpretation:**  
- **Filter summary:** Shows how many reads passed each filtering step.  
- **Sorting:** The interactive table allows sorting based on different columns. For example, sorting based on **percentage of input passed filter** gives insights about the sequencing quality.  
- This step shows how your data was “cleaned up” before downstream analysis.

## Feature Table and Representative Sequences

**Files:**  
- `table.qzv`  
- `rep-seqs.qzv`

**Interpretation:**  
- `rep-seqs.qzv`: Shows representative sequences for each feature (ASV).  
  - Use this file if you want to inspect the actual **FASTA sequences**.  
- `table.qzv`: Displays the **abundance** of each feature across samples.  
  - Overview: High-level statistics of frequency.  
  - Interactive Sample Detail: Tells you how many times a feature appears in each sample. It's useful for visualizing community composition and richness.  
  - Feature Detail: Frequency table of each feature.

## Phylogenetic Tree

**Files:** `rooted-tree.qza`

**Interpretation:**  
- The **rooted tree** provides phylogenetic relationships among features.  
- You can download `tree.nwk` and visualize it in:  
  - [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de) — upload `tree.nwk`
  - R with `ggtree` package (`library(ggtree)`)
- This tree is used for diversity analyses that require phylogenetic distance.

## Alpha & Beta Diversity

**Files:**
- `evenness.qzv`
- `faith-pd.qzv`
- `unweighted_unifrac.qzv`

**Interpretation:**  
- These three files have the same purpose of testing the diversity by comparing the difference between groups, but they use different statistic methods.  
- `evenness.qzv`: Compares how evenly species are distributed across samples.  
  - Look for **p-values** comparing different groups.
- `faith-pd.qzv`: Similar to evenness but uses **phylogenetic diversity** instead of counts.
- `unweighted_unifrac.qzv`: Tests **beta diversity** differences between groups.  

## Rarefaction Curves

**File:** `alpha-rarefaction.qzv`  
**Purpose:** Visualizes sequencing depth vs. observed diversity.  

**Interpretation:**  
- Look for a **plateau** in the curve.  
- Plateau = sufficient sequencing depth; no need for deeper sequencing.  
- If the curve is still rising, some samples might need higher read depth.

## Taxonomic Analysis

**File:** `taxa-bar-plots.qzv`

**Interpretation:**
- Visualizes the relative abundance of taxa at different **taxonomic levels** (domain to species).  
- Change the **taxonomic level** (e.g., level 2 = phylum, level 3 = class).  
- Most informative levels are typically **2 or 3**.  
- You can:
  - Sort samples by metadata category.  
  - Export the visualization as CSV for downstream R analysis.

## Differential Abundance

**Files:**
- `da-barplot-vegetation.qzv`
- `ancombc-level6.qzv`

**Interpretation:**
- `da-barplot-vegetation.qzv`: Identifies which species are **over- or under-expressed** among groups (based on feature IDs only).  
- `ancombc-level6.qzv`: Displays **full taxonomic names** and significance results.  
  - Shows which taxa are **differentially abundant**.  
  - You can customize by changing the taxonomic **level** parameter when running the pipeline.
